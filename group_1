Introductions:

Sarah Robinson

I am 33 years old, from East Tn. Previously I have worked in sales positions
for the telecommunications industry. I have a bachelors in marketing and 
an associates in computer and electrical engineering technology. 

I decided to give revature a shot while finishing my engineering degree
I am hoping I'll get to work with robotics eventually so pairing my 
electrical engineering degree with software engineering experience seemed
like the best move I could make!

I am excited to learn more!
